# push_swap

Push_swap was a school algorithm project regarding data sorting.

The goal ?

You have at your disposal <b>a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions</b> to manipulate both stacks.

Write 2 programs in C:
<ul>
  <li>The first, named <b>checker</b> which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on
the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers
are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.</li>
  <li>The second one called <b>push_swap</b> which calculates and displays on the standard
output the smallest progam using push_swap instruction language that sorts integer
arguments received.</li>
</ul>

Global variables are forbidden.

You have to handle errors in a sensitive manner. In no way can your program quit
in an unexpected manner (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).
Neither program can have any memory leaks.

Only the following functions are allowed : write, read, malloc, free and exit.
If you need other fonctions, you have to make them from scratch.
